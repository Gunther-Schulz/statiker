# Statiker — observations journal

Maintainer-side, outside the plugin payload. Consumers: fire-rate
reviews (prune/keep decisions on fire-born clauses) and the
validation grading (PLAN.md, Birth process steps 4-5).

Behaviour-delta signature (what a statiker run produces that a bare
session does not): a `.clippy/runs/` tracker carrying the verbatim
request + requirements head, decision lines with bases, a recorded
fresh-context attack outcome, per-unit commit SHAs, and a verify
verdict with pasted check output. A run missing any of these is a
protocol violation, whatever the code looks like.

## Fire-born clause log

(none — zero clauses at birth, per PLAN.md. Each mint gets a dated
line here: incident, clause text location, subsequent firings.)

## Observations

- 2026-08-05 — **Mint candidate (first): inherited-evidence gap.**
  First trial run (opus desk shakeout,
  beat-the-books `.clippy/runs/2026-08-05-canonical-market-identity-statiker.md`,
  Stumbles S1): statiker 0.1.1 has no clause for a run inheriting
  ANOTHER run's F/D entries — the resume clause assumes the tracker's
  entries are the run's own. Incident: inherited F5(a) was wrong in a
  load-bearing way (wrong table; a migration built on it would have
  rewritten `game_markets` while the resolver's real reference source
  `provider_markets` stayed stale); only the dispatching brief's
  "adopt only what survives your own spot-verification" line forced
  the check (corrected as that run's F10, independently corroborated
  by a blind-briefed leg). Suggested clause shape in the tracker's S1.
  Decision point: mint at run grading, not mid-run (editing the skill
  under the run evaluating it muddies the trial measurement).
  Refinement (operator-raised, 2026-08-05): the eventual clause
  should cover BOTH inheritance directions — another run's record
  (S1's case) and the same session's prior items (multi-item
  sessions; old clippy re-investigated from zero per run, a
  Sonnet-era calibration). One test for both: adopted evidence is
  PENDING until its basis passes a CURRENT-check scoped to the claim
  — recorded basis + staleness check (did the cited file change
  since the basis read? git-computable via the tracker's unit SHAs;
  note item N's own implementation invalidates reads of files it
  touched by construction). Unrecorded in-context memory never
  qualifies (paraphrase-drift class). Full re-investigation is the
  fallback where no basis exists, not the default.
- 2026-08-05 — **Booked analysis (operator-requested): delegation
  split, opus desk vs fable desk.** At trial-run end, grade the opus
  session log against statiker's own delegation rule (discovery legs
  dispatched; "consecutive discovery sweeps in the main session are
  the tell"): classify desk actions judgment-vs-discovery. Outcome
  routing: text violated → adherence stumble or weak tell-clause,
  adjustable from this run; text conformed → "would fable delegate
  more" is unanswerable from an opus log (counterfactual-modeling
  trap) and routes to the already-planned fable trial (PLAN.md step
  4) as a paired split-pattern comparison — patterns, not volumes;
  different task. Any tier-conditional delegation-pressure clause
  must arrive as a fire-born patch citing this analysis, not the
  curiosity. Consumer: the run-grading pass + fable-trial grading.
- 2026-08-05 — **Booked measurement (operator-requested): paired
  attack comparison, first opus-attack-ladder data point.** The trial
  run dispatches TWO parallel attackers on the identical locked
  design — fable (attack-of-record per the skill) + opus — identical
  briefs, blind to each other, outcomes recorded as separate
  tier-labeled tracker entries before any merge; run proceeds on the
  union of confirmed findings. Post-run grading (here, not the desk):
  set-compare the raw finding-sets — what did opus miss against the
  fable ceiling, what did it add. Caveat carried: n=1 pair informs,
  never certifies (significance discipline); certification stays a
  ladder. Consumer: the run-grading pass.
- 2026-08-05 — **Cross-skill routing item (charges to dispatch-guards,
  NOT statiker): §3b tail contradiction.** Trial-run incident, leg B:
  dispatch forms.md §3b closes "an enumeration dispatch … takes the
  READ-ONLY tail verbatim", while §3b's own Coverage + Quotes rules
  produce artifacts that cannot satisfy that tail's one-message /
  no-file-writes terms (122 sites with both-side quotes here). Any
  agent following both must break one; leg B broke the right one
  (data file + pointer = §2 payload-vs-pointer; harness allows DATA
  files). Desk followed the skill as written — the desk's
  self-charge in its Stumbles over-blames; only the second-demand
  recovery slip is desk-owned. Fix shape: §3b gets its own return
  provision (brief-assigned DATA file for the coverage artifact,
  message = pointer + summary counts; keep no-commits /
  no-interim-messages). Route at run grading to the dispatch-guards
  corpus lane (peer-owned — not edited from here). Consumer: the
  run-grading pass.
  RESOLVED same day, operator GO ("let's fix the dispatch while we
  are here"): dispatch-guards `ff6cc4d` (0.3.6) — §3b assigns a data
  file at brief time, pointer message with per-class counts; tail
  header gains the §3b scope line; discovery/verifier tails
  untouched. JOURNAL line in dotfiles `68f5762`. Nothing left to
  route at grading; the item stays here as the trial run's incident
  record.
- 2026-08-05 — **Mint candidates (operator-interface, trial run
  [READY] moment).** (a) The [READY] presentation diffused its ask
  across prose; the operator reported "no clear format for what's
  asked of me" — clippy's menu made the ask mechanical, statiker
  dropped it as ceremony and lost the one line that wasn't ceremony.
  Candidate clause (Stop rule section): the operator-present [READY]
  presentation ENDS with one line naming what advances the run and
  that anything else is treated as an override. (b) The operator
  expected clippy-auto-battle plow-through and asked "why did it
  stop"; statiker's operator-present pause is by design and
  free-form invocation ("advance at [READY] without waiting")
  already yields auto-advance — question for grading: does that need
  an explicit mode line, or is the invocation-line route enough?
  Both decided at run grading, one incident each as provenance.
  Consumer: the run-grading pass.
  SETTLED by operator (2026-08-05, same day): (a)+(b) merge into ONE
  clause — the operator-present [READY] presentation ends with a
  standardized light ADVANCE PROMPT ("(y) advances per the
  recommendation"; anything else is free-form override) — menu-like,
  not a clippy menu; design decisions stay never-posed (loop control
  is the operator's slot, the clippy distinction that survives).
  Decision-complete; APPLY at run grading (trial run completes on
  0.1.1 for clean measurement), version bump with the S1 mint.
